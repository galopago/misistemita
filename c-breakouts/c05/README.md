Breakout for Raspberry Pi 40 pin I/O header, 4 holes 10.16 mm spaced, for mounting onto the backplate. All pins routed to 3.5 mm pitch screw terminals. This breakout is meant to be placed on top like a hat, whit the female header pointing down. Also can be used as alternative breakout board for dupont cables, soldering a female header pointing up and installed on a backplate.
