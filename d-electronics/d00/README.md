# AC-DC power supply board based on HLK-PM01 or similar modules


AC-DC power supply board based on HLK-PM01 or similar modules (HLK-PM03, HLK-PM24, etc.) with the same footprint. The board provides screw terminals with 5mm pitch, for AC input 100-240 V, and screw terminals with 3.5mm pitch, for DC output 3-24 V. Additionally, there are 4 points for mounting on compatible 10.16 mm pitch backplates.
