# AC-DC power board based on HLK-PM01 and similar modules


AC-DC power board based on HLK-PM01 and similar modules (HLK-PM03,HLK-PM24,etc) with the same footprint. The board provides screw terminals with 5 mm pich, for AC input 100-240 V and screw terminals with 3.5mm pitch, for power output 3-24 V. Also there are 4 points for mounting onto compatible 10.16 mm pitch backplates.

## Usage example 1

Power input wires (line, neutral & ground) and relay switched load terminals (neutral and line) into a single connection place for easy commissioning & maintenance. Useful for thicker cables and higher power than the managed for the screw terminals with 3.5 mm pitch
