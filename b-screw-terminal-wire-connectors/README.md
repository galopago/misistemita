## Directory structure of every board folder

* The root contains KiCad files: project, schematic and PCB.
* gerber/single directory contains ready to manufacture files, for a single board.
* gerber/panel_100mmx100mm directory contains ready to manufacture files that fits in a 100mm x 100mm panel (use Vcuts!).
* assets folder contains support files for readme.md
