# ELECTRONIC HARDWARE PROTOTYPING SYSTEM. SOLDERLESS, ROBUST AND OPEN SOURCE

Electronic hardware prototyping system. Solderless, robust and open source. Solves the typical problem of the circuit that works on a breadboard but stops working on a real-world setup. Easy to replicate and compatible with virtually every electronic module.

The system is completely open source, all the files required to create your own system (schematics, PCB, templates, etc.) are available for download.

### Build a working project in 5 steps:

1.Component selection          |2.Place components on the backplate |

3.Wire and program           |4.Attach backplate to enclosure |

Prototyping system based on 4 types (A,B,C,D) of simple, pre made PCB that follows some rules:

* mounting holes spacing are multiples of 10.16 mm.
* the connection between boards uses screw terminal connectors.
* uses generic, low cost, easily available waterproof enclosures

## How to use this repository

The PCB was developed in KiCad V5.1,


## Directory structure

* The root folder contains template KiCad files: project, schematic and PCB .
* meta dir contain some basic info and is required to use the project as a KiCad template
* a-backplates :  PCB without components, backplates for waterproof enclosures, etc.
* b-screw-terminal-wire-connectors: To make connections to external power/sensors
* c-breakouts: Converter boards between pin headers to screw terminals.
* d-electronics: Multiple passive or active components, complex circuits.
* docs directory some additional info about the project.
