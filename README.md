# ELECTRONIC HARDWARE PROTOTYPING SYSTEM. SOLDERLESS, ROBUST AND OPEN SOURCE

Electronic hardware prototyping system. Solderless, robust and open source. Solves the typical problem of the circuit that works on a breadboard but stops working on a real-world setup. Easy to replicate and compatible with virtually every electronic module.

The system is completely open source, all the files required to create your own system (schematics, PCB, templates, etc.) are available for download.

### Build a working project in 5 steps:

1.Component selection          |2.Position the components on the backplate |

## System components

The prototyping system is built around 3 key components:
* Backplates
* Electronic boards
* Waterproof enclosures

## BACKPLATES

Backplates are flat plates with a distance between holes of 10.16 mm. Backplates are classified as follows: backplates fixed to the enclosure and mechanical adapters for other kinds of modules. The backplates are made in PCB houses, however, they can be built with other materials and processes like laser cutting, CNC machining or homemade with drill and saw!.

### Backplates - fixed to the enclosure

This kind of backplates is fixed to the enclosure, all compatible boards are placed on it. The fixing of the backplate to the enclosure is done with self-tapping screws

### Backplates - mechanical adapter

This kind of adapters are used to convert modules that have mounting holes, but not compatible with 10.16 mm

The distance between holes of 10.16 mm was found after experimentation, using an universal PCB with 2.54 mm space between holes. The 3 mm of diameter was chosen because it is a very  common hole diameter in electronic modules found online)

10.16 mm of distance between holes is a good compromise between compactness and ease of attachment of accessories. Given that the distance of 10.16 mm is an integer multiple of 2.54 mm, these panels could be homebuilt with universal PCB

### Fixing elements

Different types of fixing elements for securing boards to backplate |
-----------------------------------------------------|
![](/assets/img/differentstandoff.jpg)|

To secure boards to backplate (leaving some gap to avoid shortcuts), there are many possibilities like:


### Nylon spacer without screws

This is a single piece element that allows to attach the boards to the backplate without tools, to detach them a pliers are required

### Nylon spacer with screw and nut

This element is composed of 3 pieces: spacer, screw and nut. A screwdriver is required for fastening and detachment

## ELECTRONIC BOARDS

Electronic boards are classified as follows:screw terminal connectors, breakouts and active boards. Screw terminals are used as a means of interconnection between all of them, because they work pretty well for solid wire and stranded cable, in addition no crimping is needed. Another good point is that many wires can be attached to the same terminal, very helpful for connecting wire jumpers.

### electronic boards - screw terminal connectors

This type of board is used as a connection point to the external world, organizing in the same spot, sensor inputs, outputs and power sources. Helpful to provide multiple VCC and GND connection points using wire jumpers. They also have holes compatible with 10.16 mm pitch backplates.

### electronic boards - breakouts

This type of board is used to convert DIL style electronic modules into screw terminals, they also have holes compatible with 10.16 mm pitch backplates.

### electronic boards - active boards

This type of board has some electrical/electronic component soldered in to do a specific function.

Same as homebuilt backplates, electronic boards also could be manufactured in a similar fashion, as long as screw terminals were used and mounting holes in increments of 10.16 mm were drilled

## WATERPROOF ENCLOSURES

The system is based on waterproof enclosures with the following characteristics:
* shall have mounting bosses for the PCB or backplate.
* must be able to be mounted on the wall without drilling the enclosure


### waterproof enclosures - mounting bosses for the PCB using self-tapping screws

The enclosures shall have mounting bosses where the backplate will be attached using self-tapping screws. Those holes usually came pre-drilled and should not break the enclosure

### waterproof enclosures - wall mount without enclosure drilling

The enclosures must have external mounting ears. There are other kind of boxes that have some holes in the back for mounting purposes, but those holes do not break in the enclosure. In this particular case, some additional accessories will be required.

### Fixing accessories

For enclosures with mounting holes in the back, some picture hanging accessories will be handy for mounting them.

### Cable ingress accessories

To avoid moisture and dust infiltration in the enclosure at the cable entry point, this system uses two alternatives:
* Cable glands
* Panel mount connectors

### Cable glands

Cable glands limit the amount of dust and moisture that can enter the enclosure at the cable entry point. Additionally, they provide strain support, avoiding internal disconnections. Cable glands were available in many sizes according to cable thickness. Usually they were used in permanent installations, because the enclosure has to be opened to disconnect the cables.

### Panel mount connectors

Panel mount connectors limit the amount of dust and moisture that can enter the enclosure at the cable entry point. Additionally, they provide strain support, avoiding internal disconnections.Usually they were used when wires need to be disconnected frequently. Sometimes soldering or crimping is required.
